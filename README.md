# Compiler Design

The repository provides some examples for the compiler design course in Concordia University given by Dr. Joey Paquet.

## Lexical Analyser

For the first assignment, you need to implement a lexical analyser. The file `lexer.py` implement a lexical analyser 
using one of the scanner generator (which the students are not allowed to used). You can run the lexer by the 
following command to get an idea of how the scanner work.

```
python lexer.py input/code.lex
```

You can find more test file under the `input` directory. It takes the file `input/code.lex` as input and the tokens
will be output to the screen directly.
